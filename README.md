# java-app-reverse-proxy-aws
Deployed a Java-based student registration app on AWS using Tomcat and RDS. Set up two EC2 instances: one for the app, one as a reverse proxy with Apache HTTPD. Configured secure access by allowing traffic only through the proxy and blocking direct access to the backend.
